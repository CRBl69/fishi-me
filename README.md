A social network (school project :)

## The project

We had to make a basic social network, with limited functionality. We had to make it using php, html and css only without any framework.

Some cool features:

- follow people
- search for people
- tag people with @
- instant dms with websockets
- cool profile hover previews
- keybinds for advanced users (*\*vim intesifies\**)
- themes

I changed the pictures/logos of the website as I may use them in the future and I don't want them to be used by anyone else.
