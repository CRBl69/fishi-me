A social network (it was a school project, that I took waaaay to seriously, and spent waaaaay more time on it than needed :)

## The project

We had to make a basic social network, with limited functionality. We had to make it using php, html and css without any framework. I used node but it was for something not required so it was ok.

## My vision

I really loved this project, so I put a lot more work in it than needed. I implemented a ton of features and I had a lot of fun using it with my friends who tested and played with the website.

## Result

The website is great and all, but is not by any means something that is supposed to work at scale or anything. I didn't spend any time trying to optimise it, I just had fun. I see a lot of scaling and design problems in the code and i might rewrite it in the future (using different technologies/languages). You can look at the code and do whatever you want with it. I changed the pictures/logos of the website as I may use them in the future and I don't want them to be used by anyone else.
